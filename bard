FOOP is a new programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a statically typed language, which means that the types of variables and expressions must be known at compile time. This helps to prevent errors and makes the code more readable.

FOOP is also a compiled language, which means that the code is converted to machine code before it is executed. This makes the code faster than interpreted languages, such as Python.

FOOP is a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used to write any type of program. It is particularly well-suited for writing web applications, games, and data science applications.

Here are some of the features of FOOP:

Variables can be declared using the var keyword for mutable data, the val keyword for immutable data, or without any keywords for immutable data by default.
Expressions can be used to perform mathematical operations, logical operations, and string operations.
Statements are used to control the flow of execution.
Functions can be used to group related code together and make it reusable.
Classes can be used to create reusable objects.
Singletons are objects that can only be created once.
Variables

FOOP variables can be declared using the var keyword for mutable data, the val keyword for immutable data, or without any keywords for immutable data by default.

Here are some examples of variable declarations:

Code snippet
// Mutable variable
var name = "John Doe";

// Immutable variable
val age = 30;

// Immutable variable by default
height = 175;

The var keyword can be used to declare a variable that can be changed after it is declared. The val keyword can be used to declare a variable that cannot be changed after it is declared. If no keyword is used, the variable is immutable by default.
